OpenEarable 2.0
==========================

Overview
--------
The OpenEarable 2.0 demo board is a development board featuring the Raytac MDBT53-1M module, utilizing the advanced Nordic Semiconductor nRF5340 ARM Cortex-M33 dual-core SoC. It is designed to facilitate research into ear-based wearable technologies, integrating a wide range of sensors and communication technologies for comprehensive physiological data collection.

The nRF5340 SoC embedded within offers:
- A fully-featured Arm Cortex-M33F core (application core) capable of running at up to 128 MHz, FPU, and Armv8-M Security Extension.
- A secondary Arm Cortex-M33 core (network core), optimized for network processing and running at a fixed 64 MHz.

Key Features:
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support with LE Audio capabilities.
- Extensive sensor integration including a 9-axis IMU, pulse oximeter, optical temperature sensor, and an ultrasonic sensor array.
- Open-source hardware and firmware designed under the Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA) guidelines, using Zephyr OS.
- Advanced data logging and real-time data streaming capabilities via a custom web dashboard and mobile app support for both iOS and Android.
